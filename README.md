# spikeMatcher

This is an exploration of a small snippet of neural data collected as part of my thesis work at MIT.

_Automated in vivo patch clamp evaluation of extracellular multielectrode array spike recording capability_ was published in the Journal of Neurophysiology (https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00650.2017) in 2018.
